# Python Youtube Audio Video Downloader

This is a basic Command Line Program written in Python.

I have used pafy, pytube and sys module of Python

## Pre-Requesits

- Installed Python Version > 2.0
- Installed Python Library (PAFY, PYTUBE, SYS).

## TODOs

In `main.py` you have to add all these.

`SAVE_PATH = 'YOUR PATH FOR DOWNLOAD FOLDER'`

Then you can execute this script by running `python main.py`
